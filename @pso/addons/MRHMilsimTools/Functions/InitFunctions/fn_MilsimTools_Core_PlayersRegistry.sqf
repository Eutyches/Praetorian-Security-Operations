Function name: MRH_fnc_MilsimTools_Core_PlayersRegistry
Author: Mr H.
Description: keeps track ON THE SERVER of all players,online at startup, currently online, disconnected midgame, dead and still on server, dead (including those who have disconnected) each player is stored in an array containing:
[0 - <NUMBER> player UID, 1 - <STRING> player name,2 -<NUMBER>Owner ID as known to the server].
The function generates 6 tables in the missionNamespace that are constantly updtated.
"MRH_MilsimTools_Core_allPlayersAtInit" ==> players that were present at mission start, only updated once at startup
"MRH_MilsimTools_Core_allPlayersOnline" ==> players that are currently online, updated whenever a player logs in or disonnects
"MRH_MilsimTools_Core_allDisconnectedPlayers" ==> players that left the server midgame, updated whenever a player leaves or comes back to the server.
"MRH_MilsimTools_Core_allCurrentlyDeadPlayers" ==> players that are currently dead, updated whenever a player dies or is revived, reconnecting dead players will be killed automatically.
"MRH_MilsimTools_Core_allIncludingDisconnectedDeadPlayers" ==> (remove from above list when disconnected, remove from this list when re connected)
"MRH_MilsimTools_Core_allAlivePlayers" ==> lists all alive players
Return value:None
Public:No
Parameters: None
Example(s):
called on server only by cba post init eventhandlers
