Assets include:
- A modified version of [MRHMilsimTools](https://github.com/MisterHLunaticwraith/MRHMilsimTools) -- Fully open source, duplicable. See the [Wiki](https://mrhmilsimtools-arma3-mod.fandom.com/wiki/MRHMilsimTools_ARMA3_Mod_Wiki) for full licensing information.

- Modified assets from the [Military Gear Pack](https://forums.bohemia.net/forums/topic/190091-tier-1-gear-pack/) by Adacas -- Because we have only modified select assets from MGP, mostly having made retextures that are linked to the original MGP, we also **require our members to subscribe to the original Military Gear Pack, having made Military Gear Pack a dependency for subscription to this mod in the Steam Workshop.** If, nevertheless, the author would like these modified assets to be removed, we will do so. Do *not* duplicate anything marked "mgp," "Military Gear Pack," "Tier 1," or similar. 

- The most recent version of [ACEX](https://github.com/acemod/ACEX) with the "sitting" addon pulled from v.3.1.1, which is the last version to be fully compatible with Enhanced Movement. Part of the [ACE3 Mod project](https://github.com/acemod) -- Fully open source, duplicable. Licensed under the GNU General Public License v2.0.
