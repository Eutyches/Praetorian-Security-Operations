- Modified assets from the [Military Gear Pack](https://forums.bohemia.net/forums/topic/190091-tier-1-gear-pack/) by Adacas -- Assets modified with respect to the original author. The original author does not seem to be responsive to requests for rights to modify, so we borrow these assets tentatively. For respect to the author, and because have only modified select assets from MGP, we also **require our members to subscribe to the original Military Gear Pack, having made Military Gear Pack a dependency for subscription to this mod in the Steam Workshop.** If, nevertheless, the author would like these modified assets to be removed, we will do so immediately. Do *not* duplicate anything marked "mgp," "Military Gear Pack," "Tier 1," or similar.
