The GNU Lesser General Public License v3.0 applies *only* to the changes made by PSO or the assets specifically created by the PSO team. The licenses of the outside original mods are to be preserved.

Assets include:

- Modified assets from the [Military Gear Pack](https://forums.bohemia.net/forums/topic/190091-tier-1-gear-pack/) by Adacas -- Assets modified with respect to the original author. The original author does not seem to be responsive to requests for rights to modify, so we borrow these assets tenuously. For respect to the author, and because have only modified select assets from MGP, we also **require our members to subscribe to the original Military Gear Pack mod.** If, nevertheless, the author would like these modified assets to be removed, we will do so immediately. Do *not* duplicate anything marked "mgp," "Military Gear Pack," "Tier 1," or similar. 

- Many PSO-specific tweaks.
